:wave: Hi there, I am Matthew. 

I am currently studying a postgraduate degree for Financial Technology at the University of Strathclyde and have recently completed an undergraduate for Software Development. 
In the last couple of years, I began looking into investing, big data to blockchain technology which further grew my curiousity and led me to pursuing a Masters in Financial Technology.

I believe there is still much innovation to with technology. With my background in Software Development combined with the new knowledge and analytical skills I am developing in my postgraduate programme, 
I will be able to make a valuable contribution to society by using technology and leveraging data to improve the quality of life for many people in our society.
